## What is this?

This is the assembled memory of Rowena Harris, put together by her long-time friend as a thank you for being such a lovely person.

## Creating a new memory

Enter the dashboard by going to [/admin/](/memorybox/admin/)

On the  dashboard, select 'Posts' in the left hand menu

Select the ‘Create New’ button at the head of the page, and then ‘Post’

You then need to choose the title of your memory and ‘Create’ to move on. This takes you to the post editing page.

The current date will appear by default. Click in this field to bring up a date selector to choose the correct date for your memory

You can add a tag underneath (for example ‘holiday’) which will group similar memories together in a search. Tab after each tag you write to save it.

The main page content is written in the right hand area. A formatting bar at the bottom allows you to add bullets, lists and headers. Heading 2  is a good size for titles within posts

## Adding an image

You can insert an image in two ways;

1. By adding the URL of an online image
2. By uploading an image file to the site

You can start either of these options by selecting the image icon in the formatting bar. If you have a URL to use, this can be entered directly in the dialogue box. If you are uploading an image, select the ‘open’ button to open the media library

Once in the media library, you can choose an existing image from the library by selecting it and clicking the green ‘Insert’ button in the top right of the screen

If you need to upload a new file, click the empty box with the + sign to start the process. Once an image is chosen it will be added directly to the page

## Publishing a new memory

By default all new memories are saved as draft by clicking the ‘Save Draft’ button. You can publish this by going to the main posts list in the left hand menu and clicking ‘publish’ next to the new page.

The new content will take about 10 minutes to show on the live site and get added to the search function

## Technical bits

The site has been created using a static [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) site running [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate blog posts. The search is powered using [Jekyll Tipue Search](https://github.com/jekylltools/jekyll-tipue-search) (which is pretty great). A front-end CMS for the site is provided by [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) which makes GitHub altogether less scary

Source code for the site is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/electronicdreamplant/memorybox/tree/gh-pages)
